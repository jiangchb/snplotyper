SNPlotyper - Aiming to do for SNPs what ACP Haplotyper did for microsatellites, well maybe a little more too.

Major information:

SNP - The SNPs that were genotyped in the strains
Sequence
Alleles
Map locations on genome build(s)

Strains - The rat strains that were genotyped for the various SNPs
Symbol
source
lab
MDC designation

Genotypes - join between SNP and Strain
target and allele (A/T - means usually A but the minor allele is T?)
BN expected genotype
Observed genotyped in each strain (range of values, 0,1,2,5,6)


Goals:

Need to be able to visualize the SNPs across the strains in a similar fashion to ACP haplotyper
Integrate SSLP and SNP data together to compare & contrast


SNP export to Haploview, etc.

Select region
[Choose partition algorithm]
Select output options
* Visual haplotype (phased haplotype, snployper default view)
* Haploview
** If Haploview, need to select parameters for tag snp selection, marker inclusion, etc
** Have a form to enter params, defaults based on Ernie's settings - but ultimately these should come from a config file or database table, unique to a user
Create haploview compatible files from database for the region(s) selected
Run haploview in batch mode with the options provided
Save the files in a directory and provide web front end.
* Perhaps save top level web page and associated files, images, output, etc. in single dir that can be archived and sent back to user.

TODO Restore primary strain selection when editing, highlight on history table
TODO Create graphics for Edit This Analysis and Start new Analysis buttons on Visualize view
